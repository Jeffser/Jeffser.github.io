            Hi, my name is Jeffry, I'm a software development student, I'm always trying to improve my skills and make cool stuff.<br>
            I've been coding since I was a kid, recently I started developing web pages and web applications, as you can see I have my own neat website made from 0.<br>
            If you wish to see my code you can checkout my GitHub profile. If you have any questions or you need help with something hit me up at my Discord.<br>

        <h1 class="tertiaryText title">Hi!</h1>
        <div class="borders">
            It's been a while since I've updated my website doesn't it?<br>I've been busy with personal projects, but now I'm working on this new website.<br>
            The idea is just to make it as simple as possible, no widgets, no nothing, just a website...<br>
            Well there are new stuff like a metadata system where every page has it's own JSON with the color palette and categories. <br>
            I also want to add different sections like blogs, projects and stuff about me.
