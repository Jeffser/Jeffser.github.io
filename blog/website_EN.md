# About the website

Throughout my journey, I have embarked on the task of redesigning this website numerous times. However, it is important to note that this constant iteration does not stem from a sense of dissatisfaction with my previous work. On the contrary, it is driven by my unwavering commitment to improvement and my insatiable desire to explore new avenues within web development.

With each iteration, I have delved deeper into the intricacies of the craft, acquiring invaluable knowledge and honing my skills along the way. One area in which I have particularly focused is the implementation of colors. Recognizing the significance of visual aesthetics, I have carefully considered the color palette for this latest rendition. After careful deliberation, I have decided to embrace the widely acclaimed Everforest palette, which promises to enhance the overall user experience and create a visually captivating environment.

## Inspiration

The website draws inspiration from the Gnome Desktop, a renowned interface that has captured my admiration. Particularly captivating to me is the seamless transition between the desktop and overview mode, which serves as a testament to the power of user-centric design. However, I have taken this inspiration and infused it with my own unique perspective and creative touch.
