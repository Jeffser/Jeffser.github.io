# Experience With Linux

My journey with Linux began in 2015, and over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for its unique features and benefits. One aspect that has truly captivated me is the ability to personalize and customize the look and feel of my desktop environment, free from concerns about viruses or bloatware that are often associated with other operating systems like Windows. Linux provides a refreshing sense of freedom and control, allowing me to tailor my computing experience to my exact preferences.

Beyond the aesthetics, Linux offers numerous advantages, particularly in areas such as software development and user-created applications. The vast array of available software, diverse repositories, and a wide range of Linux distributions present an expansive playground for exploration and experimentation. While it may initially seem overwhelming for newcomers to navigate the choices of distros, desktop environments, and terminal-based applications, I firmly believe that with a little research and hands-on testing, anyone can unlock the full potential of this exceptional operating system.

Linux empowers users to break free from limitations, embrace open-source innovation, and contribute to a vibrant community. With a wealth of resources and passionate individuals, the Linux community offers support and collaboration opportunities that are unparalleled in other operating systems.

## Ubuntu: The first for pretty much everyone

My journey into the world of Linux began with Ubuntu. It all started when my family computer running Windows kept crashing repeatedly. In search of stability, I made the leap to Ubuntu. However, as a newcomer, I found myself facing unfamiliar territory, from navigating the terminal to exploring the Snap Store. Looking back, I realize that if I had started my computing journey with Ubuntu instead of Windows, I would have experienced a smoother and more enjoyable transition. The familiarity with Windows hindered my full appreciation of Ubuntu's potential.

## Zorin OS: Better'ish?

Years later, with a new Windows computer in hand, my desire to continue exploring Linux led me to install Ubuntu as a virtual machine. However, frustrations arose when I discovered the integration of Bing with Windows, sparking my decision to reinstall Linux. This time, I sought a different experience and discovered Zorin OS, an Ubuntu-based system that replaced Snap with Flatpak. The transition to Zorin OS proved to be significantly easier and more enjoyable, offering a refreshing alternative to my previous encounters with Linux.
